    "An iterator is an object which contains a countable number of values and it is used to iterate over iterable objects like list, tuples, sets, etc. Iterators are implemented using a class and a local variable for iterating is not required here, It follows lazy evaluation where the evaluation of the expression will be on hold and stored in the memory until the item is called specifically which helps us to avoid repeated evaluation. As lazy evaluation is implemented, it requires only 1 memory location to process the value and when we are using a large dataset then, wastage of RAM space will be reduced the need to load the entire dataset at the same time will not be there.\n",

    "Generators are implemented using a function. Just as iterators, generators also follow lazy evaluation. Here, the yield function returns the data without affecting or exiting the function. It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they wonâ€™t store the entire sequence in the memory."

    "List comprehension returns a list, whereas the map function returns an object of Iterable. List comprehension execution is faster than that of map function when the formula expression is huge and complex. Map function is faster than list comprehension when the formula is already defined as a function earlier. List comprehension has a simpler configuration than the map function. List comprehension can be used together with if condition as replacement of filter method. Map function has no such functionality. However, we can feed the map function output to the filter function.  "
